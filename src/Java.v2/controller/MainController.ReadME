Controller package & class(es) can be created here.

You can find controller name from dispatcher.xml, it should be the "base-package" name. Best practice is to copy and paste
the controller name from dispatcher.xml and paste it when creating a new folder.

Followed by naming the class "MyController", "MainController" or "HomeController"
